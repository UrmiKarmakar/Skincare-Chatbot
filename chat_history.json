    "user": "what is my skin type?",
    "bot": "Hi Urmi! As an AI, I can't physically examine your skin or diagnose your skin type.\n\nTo get an idea of your skin type, observe how your skin feels and looks a couple of hours after cleansing:\n*   **Oily:** Feels greasy, looks shiny, larger pores.\n*   **Dry:** Feels tight, flaky, often dull.\n*   **Combination:** Oily in the T-zone, dry or normal elsewhere.\n*   **Normal:** Feels balanced, not too oily or dry.\n*   **Sensitive:** Prone to redness, itching, or stinging.\n\nFor a definitive answer, a dermatologist can assess your skin directly."
